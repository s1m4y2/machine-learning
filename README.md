# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning projects repository! This repository contains various machine learning projects that I've worked on as part of my learning journey. Each project is designed to tackle a specific problem or demonstrate a particular technique in machine learning.

## Projects

### 1. Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews
- **Description:** Analyzing customer reviews to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
- **Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK
- **Key Concepts:** Text preprocessing, Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Random Forest

### 2. Image Classification with CNNs
- **Description:** Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Key Concepts:** Convolutional layers, Pooling, Dropout, Softmax

### 3. Predicting House Prices
- **Description:** Implementing a regression model to predict house prices based on various features.
- **Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Key Concepts:** Linear regression, Feature selection, Model evaluation

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-projects.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ml-projects/project-name
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to see the project in action.
